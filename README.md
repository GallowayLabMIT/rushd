A package for maintaining robust, reproducible data management.

## Rationale
Science relies on repeatable results. `rushd` is a Python package that helps with this, both by making sure that the execution context (e.g. the state of all of the Pip packages) is saved, alongside helper functions that help you cleanly, but repeatedly, separate data from code.

## Install
This package is on Pip, so you can just:
```
pip install rushd
```

Alternatively, you can get built wheels from the [Releases tab on Github](https://github.com/GallowayLabMIT/rushd/releases).

## Quickstart
Simply import `rushd`!
```
import rushd as rd
```

## Documentation
See the documentation available at https://gallowaylabmit.github.io/rushd

## Developer install and contributing
If you'd like to hack locally on `rushd`, after cloning this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GallowayLabMIT/rushd.git
$ cd rushd
```
you can create a local virtual environment, and install `rushd` in "development (editable) mode"
with the extra requirements for tests.
```
$ python -m venv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate    (on Windows)
$ source env/bin/activate   (on Mac/Linux)
$ pip install -e .[dev]     (on most shells)
$ pip install -e '.[dev]'   (on zsh)
```
After this 'local install', you can use and import `rushd` freely without
having to re-install after each update.

### Pre-commit
We use something called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically
run linters, formatters, and other checks to make sure the code stays high quality.

After doing the developer install and activating the virtual environment, you should run:
```
$ pre-commit install
```
to install the git hooks. Now, pre-commit will automatically run whenever you go to commit.

### Testing with pytest
We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to test our code. You just type:
```
$ pytest
```
to run all tests, though you can add an optional argument to run some subset of the tests:
```
$ pytest tests/test_file_io.py
```

Pytest automatically discovers tests put in the `tests` directory, whose files and functions
start with the word `test`.

### Code coverage
On every push, all of the tests are run and the **coverage**, or which lines are "covered"
or executed during all tests, is calculated and uploaded to
[Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/github/GallowayLabMIT/rushd). This is a nice way of
seeing if you missed any edge cases that need tests added.



## Changelog
See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed changes.
```
## [0.5.0] - 2024-04-15
### Added
- Added new `rd.plot.debug_axes` which draws guide lines to help with axis alignment.
- Added new `rd.plot.adjust_subplot_margins_inches` which allows subplot configuring
  using inch offsets (instead of subfigure coordinate offsets)

### Modified
- `rd.flow.load_csv_with_metadata` and
  `rd.flow.load_groups_with_metadata` can now load a subset of columns.
- The `datadir.txt` can include paths that use `~` to represent the home directory.
- `rd.plot.generate_xticklabels` does not include metadata key labels in plots without yticklabels
- `rd.plot.generate_xticklabels` no longer throws an error when xticklabels don't match the dictionary passed (instead leaves labels as-is)
- `rd.plot.generate_xticklabels` now enables user-specified line spacing

## What does the name mean?
The name is a reference to [Ibn Rushd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes), a Muslim scholar born in CÃ³rdoba who was responsible for translating and adding scholastic commentary to ancient Greek works, especially Aristotle. His translations spurred further translations into Latin and Hebrew, reigniting interest in ancient Greek works for the first time since the fall of the Roman empire.

His name is pronounced [rush-id](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=%20%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86%20%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%AF&op=translate).

If we take the first and last letter, we also get `rd`: repeatable data!
