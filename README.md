# GitHub Pages Cache

Nothing to see here. The contents of this branch are essentially a cache that's not intended to be viewed on github.com.

The actual documentation lives on the latest branch (e.g. the default branch for the repository).

This build is based on Sphinx, and uses a custom Python build script plus includes some of
Michael Altfield's work on building multi-branch documentation:
